# UFOS

## Project Overview

Based on a Javascript file filled with UFO sighting information, I am using JavaScript to create a table of the data as well as filters that help users see the UFO sightings of their interest. This table will be displayed using HTML and will be accompanied by headings and a brief blurb about UFOs.

## Results

The result of this project is a dynamic webpage (pictured below).
